_African DH Indabas: Occasional conversations on African Digital Humanities at the Institute for Digital Research in the Humanities, University of Kansas._

The African DH Indabas proceed from the African digital storytelling event in October as a focused and smaller avenue for occasional African DH discussions in which mostly Africa-based digital humanities scholars are in conversation with each other, or with colleagues from other parts of the world. The idea of the indaba suggests our commitment at AAAS/IDRH-KU to creating a global community of leaders and experts in African digital humanities.
